# Color-and-vocab-project-using-HTML-and-CSS
Hey there! THis is my color and vocab project using HTML and CSS . In this all the colors have their spanish names and i have cloured the boxes and the text by using CSS in an external sytles.css file . I have also attached goal.png to verify that my index.html is looking same as the provided goal.
